Topic:-AI Driven Last-Mile Agri-Marketplace 
Overview:-AI-Driven Last-Mile Agri-Marketplace is a smart digital platform designed to connect small-scale farmers directly with urban consumers. The system eliminates middlemen, reduces logistics costs, and minimizes food waste using AI-based demand forecasting and route optimization.

Problem Statement:-
1.Small farmers face major challenges:
2.Fragmented supply chains
3.Middlemen capturing most of the profit
4.Rural delivery costs 2–3x higher than urban areas

Proposed Solution:-
1.Direct Farm-to-Consumer Marketplace
2.Dynamic Pricing Support:-AI helps determine optimal pricing based on predicted demand and supply trends.
3.Hub-Based Delivery Consolidation:- Produce is aggregated at local hubs before delivery, reducing per-unit transportation costs.
4.Route Optimization Engine:- Implements nearest-neighbor optimization to reduce delivery distance and fuel consumption.
